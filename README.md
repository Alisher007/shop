## ÔøΩÔøΩ Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Alisher007/shop.git](https://github.com/Alisher007/shop.git)
    cd shop
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory. This file will store your environment variables, including sensitive credentials.
    ```
    # Example .env content (replace with your actual values)
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='your_django_secret_key_here'
    STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY='pk_test_...'
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY='sk_test_...'
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET='whsec_...'
    DEBUG=True
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
    # Add other environment variables required by your Django app
    ```
    * **Important:** Never share your `.env` file or commit it to version control.

3.  **Build and run Docker containers:**
    This command will build the Docker images and start all services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., Django app, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery).
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    Execute Django migrations to set up your database schema.
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your administrative user.

6.  **Access the application:**
    The application should now be accessible in your web browser at:
    `http://localhost:8000`

    * For the Celery Flower monitor (if configured in your `docker-compose.yml`): `http://localhost:5555`

### Running Celery and Celery Beat (if not auto-started by docker-compose)

If your `docker-compose.yml` doesn't automatically start Celery workers and Celery Beat, you might need specific service names. Assuming `celery_worker` and `celery_beat` as service names:

```bash
# To start Celery worker
docker-compose exec web celery -A core worker -l info

# To start Celery Beat
docker-compose exec web celery -A core beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
